# This is template code to create a GitHub App server.
# You can read more about GitHub Apps here: # https://developer.github.com/apps/
#
# On its own, this app does absolutely nothing, except that it can be installed.
# It's up to you to add functionality!
# You can check out one example in advanced_server.rb.
#
# This code is a Sinatra app, for two reasons:
#   1. Because the app will require a landing page for installation.
#   2. To easily handle webhook events.
#
# Of course, not all apps need to receive and process events!
# Feel free to rip out the event handling code if you don't need it.
#
# Have fun!
